# Twitter redesign Ruby on Rails Capstone project.

> I base this project on the Twitter web app. This project is a capstone project for Ruby on Rails framework. I learned a lot while I was doing the app; It was challenging at the beginning, but I overcome all the difficulties and I created a full stack application.
>This app works as a social media where you can share your opinions about movies.
>Users can create an account with the username and logging using the username.
>You can share your opinions and see the opinions of other people.
> Gregoire Vella created the original design, you can see it [here](https://glacial-cove-94894.herokuapp.com/)
